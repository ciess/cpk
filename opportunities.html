	<p>California is our culture. Passion, our heritage. This is the place for taste makers, rule breakers, and earth shakers. Every day, we conquer challenges by daring to work on the edge and thinking outside the box. We innovate, in an anything-but-ordinary, legendary sort of way. And we never settle for the norm. At California Pizza Kitchen, this fearless philosophy continues to redefine our game and we play to win. So we celebrate people like you. Your triumphs. Your careers. The way you bring the biggest and best parts of yourself to work and to our communities. Because when you create phenomenal experiences for our guests and strengthen our core with your CPK soul, thereâ€™s no stopping us. So go ahead. Be bold. Be you. Be EPIC. </p>
